# MemoraLocal Specification

## Overview
MemoraLocal is designed to capture audio snippets, metadata, and screenshots, store them locally when offline, and upload them to a server when online. The data is processed (e.g., transcribed) and made queryable for users.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Audio Recording:**
   - Record audio in 10-second chunks.
   - Support multiple platforms (web, mobile, desktop).
2. **Metadata Collection:**
   - Capture timestamp, GPS location, screenshots, and user information.
3. **Local Storage:**
   - Store data locally using IndexedDB or equivalent.
4. **Uploads:**
   - Automatically upload data to the server when online.
   - Retry failed uploads with exponential backoff.
5. **Transcription:**
   - Process audio using Faster Whisper or similar tools.
6. **Querying:**
   - Allow users to search and retrieve past recordings and summaries.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Handle large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Security:** Encrypt sensitive data during storage and transmission.
- **Scalability:** Support multiple users and devices.

## Data Flow
1. Client records audio and collects metadata.
2. Data is stored locally if offline.
3. When online, data is uploaded to the server.
4. Server processes the data (e.g., transcription) and stores it.
5. Users can query the processed data through the client.

## Future Enhancements
- Add AI-powered summarization and fact extraction.
- Enable multi-device synchronization.
- Provide advanced querying and visualization tools.
