# MemoraLocal

**MemoraLocal** is a cross-platform application designed to act as an external memory backup. It records audio snippets, captures metadata (e.g., timestamps, GPS location, screenshots), and uploads them to a server when online. The data can later be queried to help users reconstruct their past experiences.

## Features
- **Audio Recording:** Captures audio in chunks (e.g., 10 seconds).
- **Metadata Collection:** Stores date/time, GPS location, screenshots, and user information.
- **Offline Storage:** Saves recordings locally when offline.
- **Automatic Uploads:** Uploads data to the server when online.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on browsers, Android, Windows, Linux, and more.

## Project Structure
- `client/`: Frontend code for the web and mobile/desktop apps.
- `server/`: Backend code for handling uploads, transcription, and storage.
- `docs/`: Documentation and specifications.
